ASTROORG does not just look at the matching or diagnose from the sun constellation, but based on various data.  We provide foundation date analysis, astrological consultation, and people matching through thorough analysis of the horoscope by the registered professional astrologists.

Each person has a blueprint for life based on a horoscope, people to meet, what to work on and learning by that are prepared. Even though if you work on difficult tasks or walking with some not ideal partner, we believe the learning in the design drawing can be obtained accordingly.

Algorithm development and the site supervisor appraisers are studying under professional astrologer, Mr. Zephyr. Please understand about the following notes about appraisal and the algorithm matching. Only to those who have agree, we will provide appraisals and matching.

Notes

Astrology is not a "covert" but a way of interpreting how the power of the star affects each person, how that person is masterful of the power of the star. Based on the conclusions drawn from the appraisal, what kind of choice and decision making will be up to you personally.

Everyone has 100% responsibility in their life. In that sense, astrology is just one of the tools people can use for their decision-making. We can not assume the responsibility to any situation caused by appraisal. The soul of a person is reborn. Among them, improvement or descent is depends on the person himself. What has come to light through the scientific research of reincarnation is that before people are born in this world, people are born with the creation of a design map of their own life.

We think that what is called blue print is what is displayed in this worldly is a horoscope chart. Therefore we believe that the fate and luck shown there is essentially the one selected by the soul of the person himself and not what God or heaven forcibly gave to that person.

Therefore, the appraisal that we do is not a decipherment from the conventional fate-oriented standpoint.
