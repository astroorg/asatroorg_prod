ASTROOMIAI does not look at matching from simple Sunâ€™s sign. Algorithm looks at the following broad range of data and also the registered astrologists looks up the synastry, progress/transit chart to find the right person in the right timing.

ASTROOMIAI does not introduce just a person who is compatible. Each person has life chart by horoscope which tells what you have to learn and what kind of people you have to meet. Even with those person who has less compatibility, by living the life together, you will learn what you have to in the chart.
